# docker-compose
This project is mainly used for learning purposes. I am trying to learn Docker Compose and see how to containerized the app with multiple services

Run it by docker-compose run -> to run the same as python app.py
Run it by docker-compose run -d -> to run the background 
Run it by docker-compose stop -> to stop the services
Run it by docker-compose restart -> to restart the services 
run docke-compose --help -> Getting all the commands of docker-compose
